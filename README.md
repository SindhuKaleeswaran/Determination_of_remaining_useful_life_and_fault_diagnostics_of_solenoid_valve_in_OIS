# Determination-of-remaining-useful-life-and-fault-diagnostics-of-solenoid-valve-in-OIS
The life support system (LSS) within a submarine ensures crew safety and
sustenance during underwater missions. The Oxygen Injection System (OIS) within the LSS
is crucial for supplying breathable air to the crew through various oxygen valves. Our model
consists of two main components: firstly, a cohesive fault diagnostic for the oxygen valves,
using a multimeter and pressure gauge to diagnose and monitor the functioning of two-way
internally piloted solenoid valves in the OIS. This is implemented through MATLAB
Simulink &Python for various time intervals in the operational range. Secondly, the
estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the OIS is achieved through a Bayesian
Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) model & Kullback Leibler (KL) Divergence by
using the data obtained after fault analysis. This comprehensive approach considers various
ambient parameters & human parameters to estimate the RUL in hours & mins. Therefore,
the OIS and LSS are integrated which then ensures smooth functioning of the submarine
that allows detection of faults in a timely fashion, avoid leakage in O2 valves and provides
time to time data on the RUL to the crew members.
